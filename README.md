FrostVista is a lightweight, educational operating system kernel targeting **RISC-V 64 (Sv39)**.

Unlike typical hobby kernels that stay in physical memory, FrostVista implements a **Higher Half Kernel** architecture. It boots in M-mode, enables paging, cleans up identity mappings, and executes strictly in the upper virtual address space (`0xFFFFFFC080000000`).

## 🚀 Roadmap (v0.4 - The File System & I/O Milestone)
With memory and process lifecycles firmly established in v0.3, the v0.4 release bridges the gap to persistent storage and unified Unix I/O. This milestone breaks FrostVistaOS out of the "memory island," introducing a Virtual File System (VFS), block device caching, and standard file descriptors, laying the necessary groundwork for complex applications and future file systems like ext2.

### Phase 1 - Virtual File System (VFS) Abstraction
 - [x] **VFS Interface**: Define generic `inode`, `file`, and `superblock` structures to decouple the core kernel logic from specific file system implementations.
 - [x] **File Descriptor Table**: Implement a per-process FD table within `struct Process` to unify standard I/O, files, and devices under a single integer abstraction.
 - [x] **Core I/O Syscalls**: Implement the foundational Unix I/O interface, including `sys_open`, `sys_read`, `sys_write`, `sys_close`, and `sys_dup`.

### Phase 2 - Block Device & Buffer Cache
 - [x] **VirtIO Disk Driver**: Implement a VirtIO-compliant block device driver for QEMU to handle asynchronous disk read and write requests.
 - [x] **Buffer Cache (Block Cache)**: Develop an LRU-based memory cache for disk blocks to minimize slow I/O operations and manage concurrent block access using spinlocks/sleeplocks.
 - [x] **Interrupt-Driven I/O**: Utilize external interrupts to handle disk responses asynchronously, allowing the CPU to execute other processes instead of spinning.

### Phase 3 - Simple File System (Easy-FS)
 - [x] **On-Disk Layout**: Design a minimal file system backend for the VFS, featuring a superblock, block bitmap, inode array, and data blocks to validate the I/O pipeline.
 - [ ] **Directory Operations**: Implement pathname translation, hierarchical directory entry management, and basic file creation/deletion logic.
 - [ ] **File Data Management**: Map logical file offsets to physical disk blocks, ensuring safe appending and reading of file content.

### Phase 4 - Inter-Process Communication (IPC)
 - [ ] **Anonymous Pipes**: Create a bounded ring-buffer mechanism in memory to allow byte-stream communication between processes, essential for shell pipelines.
 - [x] **Standard I/O Redirection**: Link standard input, output, and error (FDs 0, 1, and 2) directly to the UART console driver for interactive user sessions.

## 🛠 Memory Layout

FrostVista utilizes the Sv39 virtual addressing scheme:

```text
0xFFFFFFC080000000  ->  Kernel Base (Virtual)
        |                   maps to
0x0000000080000000  ->  Physical RAM Start
```

## 🏗 Build & Run

**Requirements:**

* `riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc` (or similar cross-compiler)
* `qemu-system-riscv64`
* `make`

**To build and launch QEMU:**

```bash
make run
```

You should see the kernel enabling paging and jumping to the higher half address space in the serial console.

## 📜 Philosophy

* **Clarity over Cleverness**: Code is written to be understood.
* **Architecture First**: Implementing proper OS concepts (Virtual Memory, Traps) rather than hacking features.
* **From Scratch**: Minimizing external dependencies to understand the hardware.

## 📖 Acknowledgments

In its early development stages, FrostVista OS drew significant inspiration from the **xv6** operating system developed by MIT.  
We thank the xv6 authors for their clear, educational implementation of Unix‑like kernel concepts, which laid the foundation for our understanding of file systems, process management, and device drivers.  
The xv6 source code and accompanying textbook (https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2023/xv6.html) served as a primary reference throughout the initial design and implementation of FrostVista.
